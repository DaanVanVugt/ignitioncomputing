            <h3>Deliver your value over the web</h3>
            <p>The web has become the lowest-friction option to deliver to customers. Open standards and rapid development make it a great place to showcase your brand and value.
	    Additionally, strong competition makes it essential to have a compelling online presence.
	    This, combined with smart marketing and SEO, can put you in the spotlight.

	    <p>
		    We have been delivering on the web since 2009, and have excellent skills in front and back-end development, as well as devops and system administration.
		    All of our projects are delivered behind a CDN and on a minimized permission basis, where necessary.
		    We have a strong commitment to user privacy, and always follow applicable data protection laws, while minimizing the amount of private data necessary.

    <h3>Webpages and (mobile) apps</h3>
    <p>The difference between native apps and progressive web apps is decreasing,
    allowing a near-native experience on the popular mobile platforms from a single code base.
    We have years of experience running progressive web apps and applications delivered through app stores.
