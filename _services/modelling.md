            <h3>Complex systems, complex data</h3>
            <p> Nuclear fusion is a wide field, with many physics phenomena, many different experiments, calculations and simulations done by a diverse set of research groups. Data is generated over many geometries and physical parameters. As such, structured frameworks and interfaces are needed to ensure interoperability between different teams and data structures.</p>
            <p>ITER is developing a standard for fusion data, the Integrated Modelling and Analysis Suite (IMAS).
            We have developed a <a href="_posts/news/2021-03-21-ITER-IMAS-Python.md">pythonic, flexible interface</a> to data stored with the IMAS Access Layer, and are working on enabling access with the modern data processing ecosystem, using tooling such as xarray, netCDF, intake et cetera.

            <h3>Multi-physics and multi-scale modelling</h3>
            <p>
            We have developed a <a href="/news/2022/08/31/ITER-Persistent-Actor-Framework">new IMAS integrated modelling simulation framework</a> built on <a href="https://muscle3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">MUSCLE3</a>, which is currently used in JINTRAC and in the European Transport Simulator (ETS-PAF).
            </p>
            <p>
            This framework is the base of the new ITER Pulse Design Simulator Tool that we are developing, in consortium with CEA and Université Côte d'Azur, which will combine magnetic equilibrium evolution simulation with core transport modelling, and integrate it with the ITER plasma control systems through synthetic diagnostics.

            <h3>Digital twins</h3>
            <p>
            Building a predict-capable, understandable digital twin requires physics models, and may be aided by machine-learning methods but should not build solely upon them.
            Complementing simulators with ML surrogates is a way to profit from potential performance increases while remaining certain of results.
