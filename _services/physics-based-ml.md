            <h3>From machine-learned preconditioners to control-oriented models</h3>
            <p>
                A good understanding of your problem is essential when applying machine learning tools.
                Our team has developed cutting-edge tools for physics problems, such as

                <ul>
                  <li>Data-driven preconditioners (PreconNet), applied to plasma simulations but applicable in a wider context</li>
                  <li>Surrogate models for tokamak turbulence (QLKNN)</li>
                  <li>Machine-learned solver selection for Finite Element (FEM) codes.</li>
                  <li>Surrogate models for solution prediction in Finite Element codes.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
