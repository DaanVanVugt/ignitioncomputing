            <h3>Research software is our specialty</h3>
            <p>Our team members have advanced degrees, PhD and/or MSc, in the fields of (computational) physics and mathematics. We have developed state-of-the-art physics simulation and analysis tools and know the ins and outs of scientific software, data processing and analysis.</p>
            <p>We have extensive experience with Computational Fluid Dynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics, using non-linear MHD codes like <a href="">JOREK</a>. We are contributing to <a href="{% link _posts/news/2022-09-27-ITER-Framework-Service-Contract.md %}">modelling</a> and <a href ="{% link _posts/news/2022-08-31-ITER-Persistent-Actor-Framework.md %}">simulation</a> projects for for <a href="https://www.iter.org/">ITER</a>. Besides our fusion focus, we have developped tools for other physics applications such as glass making.</p>
	    <p>
	    We are available to help you improve your research and scientific software.
