            <h3>We build software for the future of science</h3>
            <p>Our team members have advanced degrees, PhD and/or MSc, in the fields of (computational) physics and mathematics. We have developed state-of-the-art physics simulation and analysis tools and know the ins and outs of scientific software, data processing and analysis.</p>
            <p>We have extensive experience with Computational Fluid Dynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics, using non-linear MHD codes like <a href="https://www.jorek.eu/">JOREK</a>. 
            We are contributing to <a href="{% link _posts/news/2022-09-27-ITER-Framework-Service-Contract.md %}">modelling</a> and <a href ="{% link _posts/news/2022-08-31-ITER-Persistent-Actor-Framework.md %}">simulation</a> projects for for <a href="https://www.iter.org/">ITER</a>.</p>
            <p>Fusion research software retains a crucial role in the world of private fusion initiatives. We are working on a <a href="https://flash.rochester.edu/site/flashcode.html">FLASH code</a> for a fusion start-up that is currently in stealth.</p>
            <p>We are available to help you improve your scientific and engineering software.</p>
