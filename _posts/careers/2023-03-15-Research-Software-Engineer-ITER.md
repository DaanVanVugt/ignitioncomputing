### About the job

Modern science requires good software. At Ignition Computing we support science and industry with the tools to support their research. For this position we are looking for a research software engineer that will be working at ITER, the worldâ€™s largest fusion science experiment.

You will work on-site at ITER on their Integrated Modelling and Analysis Suite (IMAS). This presents a great opportunity to contribute to world-class fusion research, by improving the integrated modelling and experimental analysis infrastructure, data access tools and visualisation capabilities.

This is a full-time assignment, initially for 1 year with the possibility to extend to 2 years. You will have the opportunity to live in one of the nicest regions of Europe, the Provence, in the south of France. You work on-site, embedded in the Science Department at ITER, while supported by us at Ignition Computing.

### Responsibilities

- Investigate potential extensions to h5web (an open source data visualisation tool with a React JS UI) to better support plotting and exploration of IMAS data stored in HDF5;
- Analyse existing solutions, then propose and implement extensions or complementary tools to improve the interaction with IMAS data (cataloguing accessing and plotting);
- Analyse and refactor the API of the Java interface of the data Access Layer library towards a better integration in modern Java-based applications;
- Design and build applications using visualisation tools and libraries;
- Improve packaging and distribution of software stacks and applications;
- Produce user and developer documentation, including tutorial and training material.

### Required qualifications

- Demonstrable knowledge and experience with Python (Java and C/C++ will be a plus) in relation to the development of scientific software;
- Extensive experience with Linux operating system (experience porting applications to different OSes is an advantage);
- Familiarity with software development using Git and CI/CD pipelines;
