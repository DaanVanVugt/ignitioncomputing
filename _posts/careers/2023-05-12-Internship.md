### About the internship

Ignition Computing is offering an exciting internship opportunity for students who are passionate about software development, machine learning and scientific research. Our ongoing project, Preconnet, is focused on accelerating numerical simulations for both industry and science through machine learning, and as an intern, you'll have the chance to contribute to this groundbreaking research. You'll be responsible for designing, developing, testing, and implementing software solutions, as well as training machine learning models to accelerate simulations.

This is an excellent opportunity for students to gain hands-on experience, develop new skills, and make meaningful contributions to ongoing research. Details for this position will be based on the requirements of your institution but will in principle be 40 hours per week. The internship is based in our Eindhoven office and the starting date is flexible and can be discussed. While several projects are available, the interpretation or even the topic of your project are open for discussion.
