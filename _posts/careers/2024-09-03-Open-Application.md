### Open Application

We're always excited to connect with talented physics software developers, computer scientists, simulation engineers, and those with expertise in nuclear fusion, engineering mathematics, high-performance computing or physics. If you're passionate about shaping the future of science through innovative software, we'd love to hear from you.
Whether you're interested in a full-time position, internship, or traineeship, feel free to send us your CV, a motivation letter, and your ideas to <careers@ignitioncomputing.com>.

### About Us

Ignition Computing is a startup in Eindhoven based on the Keizersgracht. We specialize in high-performance computing and research software, with a focus on fusion energy. As a developer at Ignition Computing, you'll contribute to programming and consulting services for both commercial and research-driven projects. We mainly code in Python, C++, and Fortran. If you're eager to grow your skills as a developer, we'd love to have you on board.

Our culture is focussed on cooperation, growth and a healthy work-life balance. We are open to flexible work-arrangements such as (partial) work from home. At Ignition Computing we believe in an informal environment where everyone is equal. We encourage our team members to contribute fresh ideas and work closely with both colleagues and customers. Our office is located in the vibrant city center of Eindhoven, where we enjoy lunches together, and wrap up the week with Friday drinks.

#### Some of the current running projects we have:

- Preconnet, a tool to benchmark and accelerate physics simulations through optimizing solver configurations, initial guesses and preconditioning.
- [ITER](https://iter.org), the world's biggest nuclear fusion project where we have multiple running projects such as working on the underlying data structures for experimental data ([IMASPy](https://pypi.org/project/imaspy/)) and developing simulation codes.
- Consulting for various Dutch tech companies such as [CelSian](https://www.celsian.nl/) and [Plasma Matters](https://plasimo.phys.tue.nl/index.php).
- Consulting for an American fusion start-up (currently in stealth mode).

To apply, send your job application, which includes CV and a salient coding sample (e.g., GitHub repository, code snippet, or project portfolio) , to <careers@ignitioncomputing.com>
