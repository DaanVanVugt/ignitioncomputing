### About the job

Modern science requires good software. At Ignition Computing we support science and industry with the software tools to support their research. One of our projects, Preconnet, focuses on accelerating numerical simulations through machine learning. Faster and more efficient simulations will result in a lower energy consumption, lower waiting times and the possibility of higher resultion simulations.

As an intern, you will most likely participate in the ongoing research for Preconnet. By developing and training models of all kinds you can contribute to the acceleration of simulations in research and industry. You will use your technical expertise to design, develop, test and implement software solutions. We encourage collaboration and personal growth, allowing you to broaden your skills across all our domains.

This position is based on the requirements of your institution but will generally be 40 hours per week. You will be based in our office in Eindhoven, but occasional remote work is possible when assignments allow. While several projects are already available, the interpretation or even the topic of your project are open for discussion.

### Your profile

- Currently doing a Bachelorâ€™s or Master's degree in a technical field, such as Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Physics, or equivalent practical experience.
- Experience with software development in general purpose programming languages.
- Ability to speak and write in English fluently.
- Experience with object oriented programming in Python preferred (but not necessary).
- Experience with Unix/Linux environments preferred (but not necessary).
- Experience with numerical simulations preferred (but not necessary).
- Ability to speak and write in Dutch fluently preferred (but not necessary).

### Starting date

- The starting date is flexible and can be discussed.
