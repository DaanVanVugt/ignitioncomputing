**Ignition Computing has joined the FuseNet Association.**

Ignition computing celebrates its new membership of the FuseNet Association! This association stimulates Fusion education in Europe. Fusenet helps students and educators alike through education development and mobility programs and it forges bonds between universities, research institutes and industry. 

As many at Ignition Computing have themselves profited directly from Fusenet's help, they look forward to providing a place for students to learn about software development for Nuclear Fusion.
