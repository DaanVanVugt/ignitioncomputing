**Ignition Computing is providing coding and consulting services for Projoules, the online platform for greenhouse growers that helps them to optimize their crops.**

Projoules is an online greenhouse crop planning tool that is revolutionizing the way growers plan and manage their crops. The tool is based on modelling the energy balance of a crop, taking into account temperature, CO2 density, and other relevant factors. This allows growers to optimize their crop growth and maximize their yield.

One of the key features of Projoules is that it is based on physics and scientific research, as well as years of experience in the field. The platform uses well-established models and algorithms to simulate the energy balance of a crop, and these models have been refined over many years. 

At the same time, the platform also takes into account the practical experience of growers, which is an essential factor in successful crop management. Rather than telling them what to do, Projoules supports growers and their expertise. The platform provides growers with a range of tools and information that they can use to make informed decisions about their crops.

Finally, Projoules is a platform that is continuously improving. The Projoules and Ignition Computing team are constantly working to refine and enhance the models and user friendliness of the platform. This means that growers can be confident that they are using the most up-to-date and effective tools for managing their crops.

In conclusion, Projoules is a powerful and innovative tool for greenhouse crop planning and management. By using physics-based models and incorporating both scientific research and practical experience, the platform provides growers with a comprehensive set of tools for optimizing crop growth and maximizing yield. With its emphasis on supporting growers and its ongoing development, Projoules is sure to continue to be a valuable tool for growers in the years to come.
