**Ignition Computing, together with an international consortium, has acquired a service contract for the development and support of the software suite for integrated modeling and analysis of ITER’s plasmas.**

The Integrated Modeling & Analysis Suite (IMAS) will be used to provide modeling support to make predictive simulations of ITER plasmas and to process and interpret ITER’s experimental data. The fusion reactor ITER, currently under construction in southern France, aims to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of harnessing fusion power.

Besides Ignition Computing, the consortium consists of companies and research institutions from France (CEA and Epsilon Ingénierie), Poland (PSNC), and the Netherlands (DIFFER).
