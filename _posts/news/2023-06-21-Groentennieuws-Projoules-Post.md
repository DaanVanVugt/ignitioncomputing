**Projoules has been featured in a groentennieuws article.**

One of Ignition Computing's projects, Projoules, has been featured in a [groentennieuws article](https://www.groentennieuws.nl/article/9536252/de-beste-modellen-beschikbaar-maken-voor-iedere-teler/). After 2 years of pleasant teamwork, we are happy to see that the product of this joint effort is being received with positive reactions.

Projoules is an online greenhouse crop planning tool that is revolutionizing the way growers plan and manage their crops. The tool is based on modelling the energy balance of a crop, taking into account temperature, CO2 density, and other relevant factors. This allows growers to optimize their crop growth and maximize their yield. The focus of this tool lies in supporting growers in improving and putting their expertise to use.
