**Interview with Computer Weekly: The essential role of computer technology in a growing fusion industry**

The global fusion landscape is undergoing a profound change. The ambition of harnessing "the energy of the Sun and stars," was traditionally persued through public projects which were government or university-funded, culminating in megaprojects such ITER. In recent years new and daring [private initatiaves have managed to gather substantial private investment](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03401-w/index.html), to seek new approaches to realizing the fusion dream. In order to encourage synergy between public and private initiatives, the [ITER organization hosted a three day workshop](https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/4042).

Some startups are working on the well established [magnetic confinement fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_confinement_fusion) pathways such as Stellerators and Tokamaks while harnessing more agile or more integrated organizational approaches and technological advances in super conductor technologies. Other start ups are exploring more exotique avenues such as [inertial confinement fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion). Regardless of the approach, the first step is to test the ideas in simulation. [Daan van Vugt spoke to Computer Weekly about five key ares in fusion research and development where high-performance and scientific computing make an impact](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366593337/ITER-workshop-highlights-the-role-of-computing-technology-in-nuclear-fusion).
