**The essential role of computer technology in a growing fusion industry**

The global fusion landscape is undergoing a profound change. The ambition of harnessing "the energy of the Sun and stars" was traditionally pursued through public projects which were government or university-funded, culminating in megaprojects such as ITER. In recent years, new and daring [private initiatives have managed to gather substantial private investment](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-021-03401-w/index.html), to seek new approaches to realizing the fusion dream. In order to encourage synergy between public and private initiatives, the [ITER organization hosted a three-day workshop](https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/4042).

Some startups are working on the well-established [magnetic confinement fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_confinement_fusion) pathways such as Stellarators and Tokamaks while harnessing more agile or more integrated organizational approaches and technological advances in superconductor technologies. Other startups are exploring more exotic avenues, such as [inertial confinement fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion). Regardless of the approach, the first step is to test the ideas in simulation. [Daan van Vugt spoke to Computer Weekly about five key areas in fusion research and development where high-performance and scientific computing make an impact](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366593337/ITER-workshop-highlights-the-role-of-computing-technology-in-nuclear-fusion).
