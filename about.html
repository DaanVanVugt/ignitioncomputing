                    <p>Ignition Computing was founded in 2020 in Eindhoven, The Netherlands, to build the software powering science. The majority of our work is in nuclear fusion research, as well as the emerging fusion energy industry.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Beyond the fusion sector, our team has developed software products applicable for general multiphysics problems, platform support for academic events, as well as application development for model-based crop-farming.</p>
